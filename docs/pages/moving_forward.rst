Moving Forward

Some Ideas for Moving Forward with the Project
----------------------------------------------

We had many great ideas for this project, unfortunately, the semester is only so long and we could not fit all of our ideas in this package.
We coded this project with the thought of making it easy to make changes or expanding in the future.

We originally were going to name the project "Cube Jam" with the thought that we would have multiple games to play based on the sense of hearing.

Other game ideas included:
  * An Ear Training game: This would be a game where a note would be played, and the player would have to guess what the note was by tapping the appropriate cube. This game mode could also train relative pitches.
  * A duet mode: In duet mode, the player would play along WITH Cozmo, not so much against him. A game based on collaboration and not so much competition.

Other ideas on how to expand could include:
  * Add a cube pagination menu
  * Add additional difficulty levels
  * Add more instruments
  * Add additional songs
  * Add a baton prop that Cozmo could use to point to the cubes
