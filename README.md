# Song Match

A game where Cozmo plays notes of a song, and the player has to match the notes by tapping blocks. Similar to the Memory Match game.

## How does it work?
Take for example the song *Mary had a Little Lamb*.

Cozmo plays the first note of the song, C, and a corresponding block flashes.
The player then taps the block that flashed to match the note.

Then Cozmo plays two notes of the song, C followed by D.
The player then has to tap two blocks to match the notes.

Next, Cozmo plays three notes of the song, C, D, and E.
The player then has to tap three blocks, and so on, until the song is finished.
