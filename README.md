A game where you match the notes of a song by tapping blocks with Cozmo.

You can view our documentation at http://cozmo-song-match.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## How does it work?
Take for example the song *Mary had a Little Lamb*.

Cozmo plays the first note of the song, and a corresponding block flashes.
The player then has to tap that block to match the note.

Then Cozmo plays two notes of the song.
The player then has to tap two blocks to match the series of notes.

Next, Cozmo plays three notes of the song.
The player then has to tap three blocks, and so on, until the song is finished or the player messes up the sequence.

## How to Run
Please see [Setup](http://cozmo-song-match.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/setup.html) under our documentation.
